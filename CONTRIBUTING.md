## Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

- Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep methods small and focused (max 50 lines)
- Use appropriate access modifiers

### Spring Boot Conventions

- Follow Spring Boot best practices
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use appropriate annotations
- Follow REST API conventions

### Code Organization

```
src/main/java/com/kds/mock/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Configuration classes
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/     # REST controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ dto/            # Data transfer objects
â”œâ”€â”€ entity/         # JPA entities
â”œâ”€â”€ repository/     # Data access layer
â”œâ”€â”€ service/        # Business logic
â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Utility classes
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `MockEndpointRequest`)
- **Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `getMockEndpoint`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `endpointPath`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PATH_LENGTH`)
- **Packages**: lowercase (e.g., `com.kds.mock.controllers`)

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Unit tests for all service classes
- Integration tests for controllers
- Repository tests for data access
- End-to-end tests for critical flows

### Test Naming

- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the pattern: `should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest`
- Example: `should_ReturnMockEndpoint_When_ValidPathAndMethodProvided`

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical business logic
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests DtoTests

# Run with coverage
./gradlew jacocoTestReport

# Run integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest
```
